# Project Status

## v1.1 durable state and truthful UI integration

The four implementation tracks are merged on `main`:

- #50 — stable SSE lifecycle (`84c298f`)
- #51 — application-owned durable conversation orchestration (`cff3d3b`)
- #52 — truthful durable run telemetry (`f55d331`)
- #53 — durable conversation UI (`60373f3`)

Issue #49 is the final integration and documentation checkpoint. Its focused
local API smoke uses the default `InMemoryStateRepository` and verifies one
backend-created conversation across two blocking `/api/ask` turns: four ordered
messages, two distinct runs with steps, a fresh FastAPI app/TestClient reload,
and durable SSE reconstruction with the expected content type, sequence,
working context, and terminal telemetry.

The local check proves reconstruction over the same explicitly injected local
repository; by itself it does **not** prove process persistence. The separate
deployed checkpoint has now passed: `60373f3` was deployed as `ai-app` ECR tag
`60373f3` on task definition `:5`; DynamoDB inspection confirmed one
four-message/two-run conversation with completed steps; and a replacement ECS
task restored the same conversation, six reconstructed SSE events, telemetry,
and TTFT in a fresh Chrome tab. Details are recorded in work history 0030.

The release is not yet CloudWatch-clean: without `REDIS_URL`, the app defaults
to `redis://localhost:6379/0` and logs connection-refused publish/read errors.
Issue #57 tracks this deployment configuration gap, so the CloudWatch-clean
criterion and v1.1 tag remain pending.

The v1.1 integration review logged two non-blocking follow-ups: #54 (stale
conversation pointers) and #55 (unavailable telemetry and partial snapshots).

## Historical baseline

Milestones 0–16 and prior public-UAT work remain historical baseline work. Any
previous live-deployment statements are not v1.1 deployment evidence; use the
current local and public UAT guides for this release's verification boundaries.
