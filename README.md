# AI Analytics POC

A small production-shaped AI analytics application exploring durable agent orchestration,
MCP tool boundaries, streaming UX, bounded context, and cost-aware execution.

This repository is being built incrementally. Milestone 1 provides the first service boundary: a
minimal FastAPI application with a health endpoint and an independently runnable empty FastMCP
service.

## Intended architecture

The completed POC will use one CloudFront hostname. Static React assets will be served from a
private S3 bucket, while `/api/*` requests will pass through an ALB to an `ai-app` ECS/Fargate
service. A separate, private `analytics-mcp` ECS service will expose bounded read-only tools over
MCP. The application service will own the Bedrock orchestration loop and durable state; Redis
will coordinate transient run events only.

## Delivery approach

Work follows the milestones in [the implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md). Each
functional milestone gets a branch, pull request, verification evidence, and a work-history
entry. The active handoff is maintained in [the progress file](docs/progress.md), and durable
architecture choices belong in [the decision log](docs/decisions/README.md).

## Security and scope

- Authentication is intentionally out of scope. The public deployment will contain only a
  public dataset and read-only analytical tools.
- AWS workloads will use short-lived role credentials. Long-lived AWS access keys and secret
  values must never be committed.
- The POC deliberately excludes Kubernetes, Kafka, RDS, OpenSearch, EFS, and vector databases.
- The deployment will use strict run budgets and a global Bedrock allowance to contain cost.

## Local development

Install dependencies and run the FastAPI service on port 8080:

```bash
uv sync --project services/app --dev
make dev
```

Run the MCP service separately on port 8001 with `make mcp-dev`. Its focused contract check is
`make mcp-smoke`; `make smoke` runs both the M0 health and M1 MCP checks.

In another terminal, verify the exact health contract:

```bash
make smoke
```

Run the automated test suite with `make test`. Useful repository commands are listed by:

```bash
make help
```

## AWS lifecycle warning

**Destroy the AWS environment when the demo week is over to prevent ongoing charges.**
Milestone 13 will introduce a `make destroy` target with the Terraform implementation. After
that milestone, review the plan and run:

```bash
make destroy
```

The canonical source requirements are tracked in
[`ai_analytics_poc_requirements_aws_v5.md`](ai_analytics_poc_requirements_aws_v5.md). The
historical bootstrap phase is complete; subsequent requirement changes follow the normal branch
and pull-request workflow.
